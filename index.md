   <h4><b>Progress Report</b></h4>
<p><b>During the soldering first I soldered the header on the opposite side of the PCB,I didn't knew this until I mounted the pcb on raspberry pi.Therefore, I resoldered it in its correct position.Secondly, while running the code in python when I compiled it dosen't showed any error but my code was not working properly. Then my instructor give me suggestion to check the Raspberry Pi GPIO pinout. Then I figured out that I was using wrong GPIO pin. Other then these two things rest everything was working smoothly for me.</b></p>

   <p><b>Down below is my soldered PCB that has been tested and is working fine. My project is on schedule but there is some changes in my bugdet the headers which i didn't mentioned in my
   bugdet luckily i got from the next door i.e the prototype lab. To give more time to my  project i started working from home so i needed one monitor , keyboard, mouse and one HDMI to VGA
   Converter. By chance i was having mouse and a monitor at home so there was no need to buy them. Therefore, i bought HDMI to VGA converter and a keyboard. Here is the  <a href=" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HarleenSaini19/parkingEaze/master/images/proof_of_purchase_keyboard_%26_converter.PNG"> proof of purchase </a>
   of both the items.
