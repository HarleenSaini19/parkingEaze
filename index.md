   <p><b>Down below is my soldered PCB that has been tested and is working fine. My project is on schedule but there is some changes in my bugdet the headers which i didn't mentioned in my
   bugdet luckily i got from the next door i.e the prototype lab. To give more time to my  project i started working from home so i needed one monitor , keyboard, mouse and one HDMI to VGA
   Converter. By chance i was having mouse and a monitor at home so there was no need to buy them. Therefore, i bought HDMI to VGA converter and a keyboard. Here is the  <a href=" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HarleenSaini19/parkingEaze/master/images/proof_of_purchase_keyboard_%26_converter.PNG"> proof of purchase </a>of both the items.</p>
